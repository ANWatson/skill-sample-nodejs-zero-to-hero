# Part 10 - ASK CLI

#   # Milestones

1. *CLI*: Install ASL CLI via NPM
2. *CLI*: Do an "ask init"
3. *CLI*: Try "ask clone"
4. *CLI*: Explain dev cycle -> git commit & ask deploy (with VS Code plugin)

## Concepts

1. Configuring the ASK-CLI with personal AWS account support
2. Cloning an Alexa Hosted Skill
3. Editing a skill in code and deploying the skill

## Diff

1. **images/**: moved images directory to top level
2. **.ask/config**: this new file now includes deployment data
3. **skill.json**: this file now includes deployment data (+uri)
